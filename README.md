# Solution structure
Base executable is ruby simulator.rb file in the root.
It should be executed as regular ruby script. At least one command line argument is required to run simpulator successfully. It should be a string with path to input instuctions file.
So something like this is rather legal (being in the root folder):
> ruby simulator.rb ./test./examples/2.txt

# Auto tests
Are You sure they are required to highlight this problem more?
If You still are, I can provide some RSpec code examples after our interview (in case it will happen).
Thank You for interesting task :)
